          {/* Step-by-step guide for the student on how to use the residency allocation system */}
          Welcome to the Residency Allocation System! This system fairly matches you with residency positions based on your preferences and performance.
          <br/><br/>
          You will start by visiting the "View Jobs Board & Submit Rankings" page to explore available residencies. Click on jobs for details, then add them to your Like or Dislike lists. Reorder them based on preference - 1 being favourite, 2 being 2nd favourite, etc. Click 'View Full Ranking' to merge lists. You must rank every job position.
          <br/><br/>
          Based on your average grade, you will then receive a list of positions you are eligible to apply for, with higher-performing students prioritised for top choices.
          <br/><br/>
          Next, submit your CV and monitor your application status on the "View Application Status & Upload CV" page. After interviews, residency partners will score you from 0 â€“ 10 - you will not see these scores. You will also submit your own post-interview rankings.
          <br/><br/>
          The Gale-Shapley algorithm combines your rankings and company scores to generate matches. If unmatched, you may re-enter later rounds until all slots are filled.
          <br/><br/>
          Once offered a residency, you must accept unless you have secured one outside the system. If unsure, contact your residency coordinator. You may edit and resubmit rankings anytime before the submission window closes; after that, forms are locked.
